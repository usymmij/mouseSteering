# Mouse Steering for Driving Games

Adapted from this steam community post by Zoom377

I only made a few small edits, so credit goes to Zoom377 for the bulk of the code

Made for Forza 5, but works on probably any other game

## PREREQUISITES

You need a recent release of VJoy to use this
https://sourceforge.net/projects/vjoystick/

## Editing the Buttons

There are 8 buttons by default in VJoy

Make sure you change it using the ConfigureVjoy App

You can add up to 32 keys by adding to the keys list in the MouseSteering.ahk script (Line 6)

To increase the maximum number of keys change maxKeys and the button number in VJoy
